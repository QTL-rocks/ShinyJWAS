  abstract = {{Genome-wide high-density molecular markers (e.g., SNPs) are increasingly being
incorporated into animal and plant breeding programs to speed up genetic improvement
through genomic prediction. The same statistical models can also be used for genome-wide
association studies. Bayesian multiple-regression methods are widely used in genomic
prediction with complete genomic data (all phenotyped individuals in the analysis are
genotyped). These methods have been extended to accommodate incomplete genomic data
(some phenotyped animals not genotyped), simultaneously using all available pedigree,
phenotypic and genomic information (“single-step" Bayesian methods). We have developed a
well-documented software tool called JWAS (acronym for "Julia Whole-genome Analysis
Software”) in a relatively new scientific programming language, Julia, which approaches the
computing speed of compiled languages such as C, C++ or Fortran, but has the benefits of
dynamic languages such as R or Python.
JWAS is a well-documented software platform based on Julia and an interactive
Jupyter notebook for analyses of general univariate and multivariate Bayesian mixed effects
models. These models are especially useful for, but not limited to, routine single-trait and
multi-trait genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies using either complete or
incomplete genomic data ("single-step" methods). Currently, JWAS provides broad scope of
analyses, e.g., a wide collection of Bayesian methods for whole-genome analyses, including
shrinkage estimation and variable selection methods. We believe the friendly user interface
and fast computing speed of JWAS will provide power and convenience for users in both
industry and academia to analyse large datasets. Further, as a well-documented open-source
software tool, JWAS will also be used by a group of active community members, who will
contribute to the source code and help maintain the project. Junior scientists can understand
and learn the methodologies for whole-genome analyses by using JWAS and reading the
tutorials and source code. JWAS is available with source code and documentation at
